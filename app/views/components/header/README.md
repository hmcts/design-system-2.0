Use the Header component for any service or system not hosted on GOV.UK such as those for the judiciary or HMCTS staff.

Do not use this for citizen-facing services.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'header',
  example: 'default',
  height: 150
})}}

## How it works

The name of the service or system appears in the top left. You can also add global links in the top right. For example, ‘Profile’ and ‘Sign out’.
