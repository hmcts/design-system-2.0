## When to use this component

You should try and have one primary action per page but sometimes you might need to signify possible actions without encouraging the user to do so.

For example, if you have a list of cases on a page and a button to create a new case, it might be that creating a case isn't the primary action. Instead, it might be clicking on an existing case is the primary action. In this case it might be better to use the secondary button.

Or you might have multiple actions on a page where some of them are used less frequently. In this case, use the secondary button. The green button should be used sparingly so that it's prominence isn't diluted.

## When not to use this component

If the action is the primary action, like filling out a form, use the [GOV.UK Button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/) component.
