## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern to help users search for something within a system. For example, a case in a case working system.

This pattern is especially helpful when users need to be able to search from anywhere as it's accessible from any page.

## Search everything

Users generally expect to be able to search for anything and by any particular detail. Try not to limit what and how the user can search.

If you must limit what the user can search for, use a specific label and hint text. For example:

- Label should be “Find case”
- Hint should be “Enter a case number or party name”

## Advanced search

Don't provide users with an advanced search page. Users prefer to search and _then_ refine their results. To do this, let users [filter their results](http://localhost:3000/patterns/filter-a-list).

## Research on this pattern

Tested well in JUI.
